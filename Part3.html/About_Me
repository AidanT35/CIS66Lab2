        <h1>The basic things about me</h1>
            <p>My name is Aidan, <hr/> I drink a lot of h<sub>2</sub>o.  
            I love music and sports.  I have been homeschooled my whole life.  
            Other than the co-op classes I have done like icap, this is one of my first classes.
            I have never really messed with this stuff like html before, I've never really been good with computers, 
            so maybe starting out college with computer classes wasn't the best idea, but I wouldn't take 
            anything back.</p>
            <h2>My career goals</h2>
            <p>My career goal is to get my degree in computer science. 
            Working somewheres like <b>Google</b>, <acronym title="National Aeronaustics and Space Administration">NASA</acronym>,
            <b>Samsung</b> or <s>Apple</s> is only a dream right now, but I am working hard to 
            make it a reality.  Lately I have been interested in missionary work. I have been thinking about doing a dts
            <dfn>(discipline training school)</dfn> through <em>YWAM</em>.  I am not for sure want I to do as a career yet.</p>
            <h2>My family</h2>
            <p>I am part of a family of four.  My brother, Quinn, has a degree in social sciences and is currently in navy
            boot camp in Chicago.  I will see him in three in weeks, I can't wait.  My mom, Raquel, was my teacher 
            for most of my life and now she is going back to school, <i>beauty</i> school.  My dad, Mario, works at Kimberly
            Clark, he is a very hard worker and is multiy-talented, most importantly, a die hard <u>Laker</u> fan.</p>
            <h2>My hobbies</h2>
            <p>Basketball<br /> my favorite teams are Lakers and OKC Thunder.<br /> I also play basketball, I played
            on a varsity team.  <q>I've failed over and over and over again in my life and that's why I succeed</q>
            -Michael Jordan is my favorite quote.  I also play four instruments, guitar, bass, piano, and I sing.  
            I only take lessons for singing currently.  I also love snowboarding, biking, hiking, rock climbing, airsofting,
            bmxing, paintpalling, shooting guns, and playing videos games.</p>
